express-validator is a middleware for validating data in a Node.js Express application. It provides a set of validation methods that you can use to check the values of incoming request data, such as query parameters, headers, and request body.

To use express-validator, you first need to install it by running the following command in your project's root directory:

Copy code
```
npm install express-validator
```
Once you have express-validator installed, you can use it in your Express application by requiring it and then adding it as middleware before your route handlers. For example:

Copy code
```js
const express = require('express');
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

const app = express();

app.post('/create-user', [
  check('email').isEmail(),
  check('password').isLength({ min: 8 }),
], (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(422).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }

  // create the user here
});
```
In this example, check('email').isEmail() is used to validate that the value of the email field in the request body is a valid email address. The check('password').isLength({ min: 8 }) is used to check the value of the password field in the request body is at least 8 characters long.

Both of the check methods return an instance of a "validation chain", you can chain on more validation methods if you need.

Copy code
```js
check('name')
  .not().isEmpty()
  .isLength({ min: 3 })
  .escape()
 ```
The validationResult(req) method is used to extract the validation errors from the request and return them as a JSON object.

Once the validation is done, you can check if there are any errors by calling errors.isEmpty() method, if it is true then you can proceed to create the user, else you can return the errors back to client.

express-validator provides many other validation methods like matches, isBoolean, isInt, isMimeType, isURL etc.

Keep in mind that the check function only checks that the field is present and not undefined. To check if a field is absent or empty, you can use not().isEmpty().

Please let me know if you want more details or examples on specific validation methods.

Give me all code in seperate validator file
Here's an example of how you can use express-validator in a separate file called validator.js and import it in your routes file:

**validator.js**

```js
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

exports.userValidator = [
  check('email').isEmail(),
  check('password').isLength({ min: 8 }),
]
```
**routes.js**

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { userValidator } = require('./validator');

router.post('/create-user', userValidator, (req, res) => {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(422).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    // create the user here
});
```
With this approach, you can keep all of your validation logic in a separate file, making it easier to maintain and reuse. You could also create a seperate validator for each routes, like for example: userValidator, productValidator, orderValidator etc.

And also use a middleware to handle the validation errors and respond to client:

```js
function handleValidationErrors(req, res, next) {
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
        return res.status(422).json({ errors: errors.array() });
    }
    next();
}
```
```js
router.post('/create-user', userValidator, handleValidationErrors, (req, res) => {
    // create the user here
});
```
This way you can use this middleware in all the routes, to handle validation errors in a consistent way.
Let me know if you have any further questions or need more details.

where should i put validator.js ?? which folder??

It's a matter of preference and the structure of your project. You can place the validator.js file in any folder as long as it's in a location where it can be imported by the files that need it.

One common convention is to create a folder called validators or middleware at the root level of your project and place all of your validators in that folder.

Another approach is to keep the validation files in the same folder with the routes they are related to.

You can also create a common folder called utils or helpers and put all common files in that folder.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to keep the structure of your project organized and easy to understand.

Please let me know if you have any further questions

pls give me tree view of all the possibilty
Sure! Here's an example of how you could structure your project with different folders for different purposes:

Copy code
```
your-project/
|
+-- config/              # contains configuration files
|   |
|   +-- database.js     # database configuration
|   |
|   +-- environment.js  # environment variables
|
+-- controllers/        # contains route handlers
|   |
|   +-- user.js         # user-related routes
|   |
|   +-- product.js      # product-related routes
|   |
|   +-- order.js        # order-related routes
|
+-- middleware/         # contains middleware functions
|   |
|   +-- validators.js   # validation middleware
|   |
|   +-- auth.js         # authentication middleware
|
+-- models/             # contains database models
|   |
|   +-- user.js         # user model
|   |
|   +-- product.js      # product model
|   |
|   +-- order.js        # order model
|
+-- routes/             # contains route definitions
|   |
|   +-- index.js        # main routes file
|
+-- utils/              # contains utility functions
|   |
|   +-- helpers.js      # contains helper functions
|   |
|   +-- logger.js       # contains logging functions
|
+-- server.js           # entry point of the application
```
Each of the above folders have a specific purpose:

Each of the above folders have a specific purpose:

- config: contains configuration files for the application such as database connection strings, environment variables, and other settings.
- controllers: contains the route handlers for each of the routes defined in the routes folder.
- middleware: contains middleware functions, such as validators, authentication and logging middleware, that are used to modify the request and response objects before they reach the route handlers.
- models: contains the database models that define the structure of the data in your application.
- routes: contains the route definitions that map URLs to route handlers.
- utils : contains utility functions which are used throughout the application like logging, helpers etc.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the above project structure.
